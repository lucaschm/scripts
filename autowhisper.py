    This script automatically transcribes multiple MP3 files. You will specify a 
    folder with these MP3 files in the next step. The script will save the transcripts 
    in a subfolder of your chosen folder. The name of this folder will be "transcripts". 

    The script will scan the "transcripts" folder for existing transcripts. MP3 files, 
    that already have a corresponding ".txt" file in the "transcripts" folder will not 
    be transcribed.

    Whisper from OpenAI is used to transcribe your audio. Whisper is a local 
    open source neural network, that uses your GPU (if you have one). Whisper 
    must be installed on this machine.
